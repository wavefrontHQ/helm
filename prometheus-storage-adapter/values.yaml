## Wavefront Proxy is a metrics forwarder that is used to relay metrics to the Wavefront SaaS service.
## It can receive metrics from the Prometheus Storage Adapter as well as other metrics collection services
## within your cluster. The proxy also supports preprocessor rules to allow you to further filter
## and enhance your metric names, and tags. Should network connectivity fall between the proxy and
## Wavefront SaaS service, the proxy will buffer metrics and flush when connectivity resumes.

## This chart depends on the "wavefront" chart for proxy deployments.
